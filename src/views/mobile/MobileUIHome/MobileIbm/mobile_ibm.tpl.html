          Biomimicry is the practice of imitating life. It is a way to address the sustainability challenges by creating
          policies, products, and processes that are adapted to live on earth. Let your innovations be fueled by nature while you
          explore this uncharted terrain.
          Kshitij, IIT Kharagpur presents an opportunity for the participants to work on real-life problems with nature in its
          novel event 'Biomimicry'.
